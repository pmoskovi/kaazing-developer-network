section1-title: Racer with Smartphone Remote
section1-body: There are some solutions out there that turn your smartphone into a Wii-style controller, but many of them require a dedicated app on your phone and even a browser plugin on your desktop. With HTML5 and WebSockets you can achieve this very quickly and easily without the need of pre-installing anything on your machine or your phone. All you need to drive the car on the screen is tilt your phone left and right, forward and backward.
