section1-title: Collaborative Presentations
section1-body: Prezing is an engaging, collaborative real-time presentation tool. Inspired by Prezi, Prezing allows you to lay out your slides in different ways, and it navigates between your slides using smooth animation. Attendees invited to Prezing see the same experience the presenter is showing, in real-time = the slides are transitioning from one to the other, the presenterâ€™s mouse cursor is shown, the presenter can even annotate the slides by drawing on them. Presenters can transfer the presenter role to any other attendee, can take back the presenter role, as well as allow attendees to navigate freely between the slides. Presenters can use their smartphones as a remote control, too.
