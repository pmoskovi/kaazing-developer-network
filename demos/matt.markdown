section1-body: The Second Screen Solution provides a synchronized viewing experience between a primary screen (TV) and a second screen (smartphone). As the events unfold on the big screen, questions, betting opportunities are displayed on the big screen. Users can place their bet and wager, scores are kept on the leaderboard. This solution demonstrates two-way real-time interaction; questions pushed to mobile devices, as well as viewers displayed on the leaderboard. To run the demo open up the Big Screen on your desktop and the Second Screen URL on your mobile device (or a desktop browser representing your mobile device). Entering your name on the Second Screen will start the demo.
