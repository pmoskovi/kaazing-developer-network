section1-title: Real-time IoT - publishing sensor data to the Web over satellite
section1-body: To demonstrate the power of real-time Web communications, we built an array of sensors, which included GPS, compass, accelerometer, temperature and humidity sensors. After attaching them to a DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter, we streamed the data through one of Inmarsat's geostationary satellites, orbiting at 22,236 miles, to Web and mobile clients over the public Web. We measured that the latency introduced by te satellite communication was about 650ms. With lightning fast communication over the Web, the overall latency of the dashboard, displaying quadcopter sensor data, was under 1 second.
